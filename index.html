                    <p>Hi, my name is Utkarsh Bansal and I am currently a student at Georgia Tech majoring in Computer Science under the Intelligence and Info Internetworks threads. Some of my coursework includes Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures + Algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Multivariable Calculus to name a few. My enthusiasm for technology is not just limited to academic pursuits; I actively engage in innovative research projects and have an avid interest in the fields of quantitative analysis, finance, and software engineering. Additionally, I am involved in a variety of activities both on and off-campus, such as the GT Student Investments Fund, Big Data Big Impact, Google Student Developer Club, and the GT Undergraduate Consulting Club. When I step away from the computer, you can find me enjoying various hobbies such as weightlifting, exploring new TV series, competing in basketball, and playing the guitar. Thanks for reading!</p>
